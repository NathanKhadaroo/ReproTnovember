# What does Open Research mean to you?

# What is Open Research?

--

For the authors, "Open science is best described as “an umbrella term used to refer to the concepts of openness, transparency, rigor, reproducibility, replicability, and accumulation of knowledge, which are considered fundamental features of science” (Crüwell et al., 2019, p. 3), along with “openly creating, sharing, and accessing research”

--

# Why Open Research?
--

bla

---


The authors suggest eight different open research practices that novice graduate students could begin adopting straight away: 

--

- Journal clubs

--

- Project workflow

--

- Preprints


--

- Reproducible code

--

- Data sharing

--

- Transparent writing

--

- Preregistration

--

- Registered reports

--

In this session we will briefly explain each of these concepts, and then have a short discussion around them.

Congratulations! You're already here.

# Project workflow

---
**What is it?**

"Project workflow refers to how you organize projects and move through the
various stages of the research cycle. This includes your file folder structure, document naming
conventions, version control, cloud storage, and other details. It also includes the choice of who
has access to the project (e.g., collaborators, the public) and when in the process they have access
(e.g., at all times, upon publication)."

--

**How to do it?**

The authors suggest an easy first step is to create an [osf account](https://osf.io). This allows you to publicly store elements of your research project, and create a citable DOI, so people can gve you credit for your work.

I would also recommend steps such as setting up an R project if you are doing your project in R, or consider using the [workflowR package](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr)

# Preprints

---

** Preprints:**

- disseminate research as soon as it's finished 
 - before submitting to a journal
 - during peer review
 
<br>

- allows feedback (informal peer review)

<br>


- compatible with most publishers' policies
 - can check with Sherpa Romeo (https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/)
 
<br>

- update with a postprints (after peer review)

<br>

- where?
 - arXiv, bioRxiv, PsyArXiv etc

# Reproducible code

---

**What?**

Reproducible code for data analysis and visualizations (e.g. tables, figures) refers
to a detailed, written version of your code that would allow someone else (or your future self) to generate the same output reported in your manuscript.

**Why?** 

- detection of errors

- ease of modification in the analysis or visualization

- facilitation of sharing and collaboration

- easy to make small changes to repeat similar steps within the same project

- scripts from one project can be used as a starting point for another, therefore saving a lot of time in the long run. 

- reproducible code allows for other people to transparently reproduce your analyses or
visualizations.

---
**Easy:**

If you are already using scripted and open-sourced software like R, Python, or Julia, great!

If you are used to using a point and click software such as SPSS (propreitary) or JASP (Open sourced)



---

**Medium:**

- Script your analysis, using open-sourced software.

Why does open sourced software matter?

Open sourced software means your analysis can be reproduced by anyone with a computer and an internet connection, regardless of their resources. This is especially relevant right now as even highly resourceful universities (like Manchester) are unable to buy 

It's important to make explicit which software you have used, and which versions of that software...

In python you can do this using:

```{python, eval = FALSE}
from sinfo import sinfo

sinfo()

```

If you are using R you can use:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```




---

**Hard:**

- Containerization:

"A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another" (Docker, 2020).

Andrew Stewart has some excellent resources on binder you can find[here](https://ajstewartlang.github.io/23_introduction_to_binder/knitted_workshop/23_introduction_to_binder.html)

# Data sharing


---



---
class: center, middle

# Transparent writing

---
# Transparent writing:

- openness
- detail
 - hypotheses
 - stopping rules
 - analysis
- can go in supplementary materials if short on space
- allows others to understand/reproduce your work
- increases trust in your results
- normalises mistakes!

# Preregistration

---
What is preregistration:

Time stamped document that includes:

- research questions

- hypotheses

- method

- data processing

- analysis plans (e.g. statistical tests)

--

Separates confirmatory from exploratory

"Stifles creativity?" Nope!
