# What does Open Research mean to you?

# What is Open Research?

--

For the authors, "Open science is best described as “an umbrella term used to refer to the concepts of openness, transparency, rigor, reproducibility, replicability, and accumulation of knowledge, which are considered fundamental features of science” (Crüwell et al., 2019, p. 3), along with “openly creating, sharing, and accessing research”

--

# Why Open Research?
--

bla

---


The authors suggest eight different open research practices that novice graduate students could begin adopting straight away: 

--

- Journal clubs

--

- Project workflow

--

- Preprints


--

- Reproducible code

--

- Data sharing

--

- Transparent writing

--

- Preregistration

--

- Registered reports

--

In this session we will briefly explain each of these concepts, and then have a short discussion around them.

# Journal clubs

Congratulations! You're already here.

# Project workflow

---
**What is it?**

"Project workflow refers to how you organize projects and move through the
various stages of the research cycle. This includes your file folder structure, document naming
conventions, version control, cloud storage, and other details. It also includes the choice of who
has access to the project (e.g., collaborators, the public) and when in the process they have access
(e.g., at all times, upon publication)."

--

**How to do it?**

The authors suggest an easy first step is to create an [osf account](https://osf.io). This allows you to publicly store elements of your research project, and create a citable DOI, so people can gve you credit for your work.

I would also recommend steps such as setting up an R project if you are doing your project in R, or consider using the [workflowR package](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr). 

This provides a number of tools which automate having a clear, reproducible, and transparent workflow, and creates a github powered website with your code and analysis.

# Preprints

---

** Preprints:**

- disseminate research as soon as it's finished 
 - before submitting to a journal
 - during peer review
 
&lt;br&gt;

- allows feedback (informal peer review)

&lt;br&gt;


- compatible with most publishers' policies
 - can check with Sherpa Romeo (https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/)
 
&lt;br&gt;

- update with a postprints (after peer review)

&lt;br&gt;

- where?
 - arXiv, bioRxiv, PsyArXiv etc

# Reproducible code

---

**What?**

Reproducible code for data analysis and visualizations (e.g. tables, figures) refers
to a detailed, written version of your code that would allow someone else (or your future self) to generate the same output reported in your manuscript.

--

**Why?** 

- detection of errors

- ease of modification in the analysis or visualization

- facilitation of sharing and collaboration

- easy to make small changes to repeat similar steps within the same project

- scripts from one project can be used as a starting point for another, therefore saving a lot of time in the long run. 

- reproducible code allows for other people to transparently reproduce your analyses or
visualizations.

---
**Easy:**

If you are used to using a point and click software such as SPSS (proprietary,ie financially exclusive and potentially unsustainable) or JASP (Open sourced) you can have your actions saved as a syntax file.

If you are already using scripted and open-sourced software like R, Python, or Julia, great! You can make your code more accessible by using open sourced tools such as R markdown or Jupyter notebooks to weave code and text.

---

**Medium:**

- Script your analysis, using open-sourced software.

*Why does open sourced software matter?*

Open sourced software means your analysis can be reproduced by anyone with a computer and an internet connection, regardless of their resources. This is especially relevant right now as even highly resourceful universities (like Manchester) are unable to buy licenses for all students.

It's important to make explicit which software you have used, and which versions of that software you have used.

In python you can do this using:


```python
from sinfo import sinfo

sinfo()
```

If you are using R you can use:


```r
sessionInfo()
```




---

**Hard:**

- Containerization:

"A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another" (Docker, 2020).

Andrew Stewart has some excellent resources on binder you can find [here](https://ajstewartlang.github.io/23_introduction_to_binder/knitted_workshop/23_introduction_to_binder.html).

There are also R packages such as [holepunch](https://github.com/karthik/holepunch) which take an existing r project and makes it so you "can launch a free instance of Rstudio server from any of your projects on GitHub. The instance will have all of your dependencies and version of R installed and ready to go! [...] Easily allow anyone (up to 100 simultaneous users) to replicate or modify your analysis!".

# Data sharing

---

** What is it? **

"Sharing data pertains to making the de-identified dataset used for a project
available to other researchers. Importantly, this means posting the data on OSF or another data
repository for researchers to download and use or establishing a formal system through which
others can access the data (useful for sensitive data)."

** How?**

For non-personal data, this is as simple as uploading your data online, usually to the osf. This makes your analysis reproducible, and allows others to cite you if they want to use your data.

For personal data this is an *extremely* sensitive task. Contrary to what is stated, de-identification is not sufficient. Furthermore there are inherent trade-offs between sharing data that is useful, and sharing data safely. For example multi-level data (such as individuals, within households, within areas) is very hard to share safely. 

For hard cases, you may have to make your data accessible only for researchers who go to a secure data facility and comply with a number of restrictions.

A useful, open-access resource is the [https://ukanon.net/ukan-resources/ukan-decision-making-framework/](Anonymisation Decision-making Framework).

# Transparent writing

---
**Transparent writing:**

- openness

&lt;br&gt;

- detail
 - hypotheses
 - stopping rules
 - analysis
 
&lt;br&gt;

- can go in supplementary materials if short on space

&lt;br&gt;

- allows others to understand/reproduce your work

&lt;br&gt;

- increases trust in your results

&lt;br&gt;

- normalises mistakes!

---
class: center, middle

# Preregistration

---
**What is preregistration:**

Time stamped document that includes:

- research questions

- hypotheses

- method

- data processing

- analysis plans (e.g. statistical tests)

--

Separates confirmatory from exploratory

--

"Stifles creativity?" Nope!
